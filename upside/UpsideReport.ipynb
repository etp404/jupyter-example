    "My first approach to this problem was to generate a histogram of the frequency outputs, and possible use a mixture of guassians model to represent their distribution. However, because I would need to take into account the state of the battery I opted instead to create a model of the system, and run it through the sample data.\n",

    "To visualise this, I generated a plot of the frequency of the system under control, and the energy held by the battery as follows. Please forgive the messiness of the code in this snippet. The model itself should be reasonably easy to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "N.B. I got bizarre results when I used a self discharge rate of 100kWh, so I swapped it out to 10 kWh. This can be altered by changing the arguments sent to the battery. I also wouldn't normally use default arguments as I have here were it a real system as it would make it too easy to make an error when creating building the objects."
